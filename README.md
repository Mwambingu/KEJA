## *KEJA - PROJECT*

```
Landlords usually have more than one apartment. To cater to all those apartments does take a lot of time and expenses. 

Keja aims to help Landlords have access to all their properties and Tenants at the palm of their hand. Know who is in which house, who has paid, when he/she is supposed to pay and issues facing their tenants. 

Keja is for Landlords that want to take real ownership in managing and dealing with their properties first hand.
